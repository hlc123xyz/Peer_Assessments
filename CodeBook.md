Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project CodeBook
===================================================
This CodeBook will describe the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I did during claening up the data.
* A full description of the data is available at the site where the data was obtained:
  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
  The data for this project is available for downloading at:

* The run_analysis.R script performs five major steps to clean the data and finally generate the new data set as required:
  1. The first step is to create a new data set that contains both trained and test data sets.
     * Rstudio commands used in this step:
       | read.table()
       | rbind()
     * Data are generated in this step:
       
       ```
       #Data              #Describtion                 #Command Used
       
       ```
